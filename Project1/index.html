<body>
<p>For this project, I will analyze trader Joe's website. I do so for the purpose of comparison; Does the website help complete the mission of Trader Joe's? I will be designing website elements for this class, and so analysis of websites will prove beneficial forr my own knowledge.</P>

<h3>I will ask the following questions in my analysis:</h3>

<ol>

<li>What was my first impression of this site?</li>
<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
<li>Does the site structure make sense?</li>
<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it?</li>
<li>How long did it take for the home page to load?</li>
<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?</li>
<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</li>
<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>

<h3>
1: First impression
</h3>
<p>
The Trader Joe's website is a cheery site, offering media and recipes that go hand-in-hand with the local and festive theme of their store. The white color scheme and news bulletin add to the simple, friendly and fun interface. While a little bit confusing to navigate, my first impression was rather positive.
</p>


<h3>
2: Site Organization
</h3>
<p>
This is the only aspect of the site that gave me a negative impression. I found the abundance of small-town media to be a bit cluttering, and the way that the site only shows one new product at a time makes viewing what they have to offer tedious. The organization of the site makes navigating a bit of a learning curve.
</p>


<h3>
3: Site Structure
</h3>
<p>
Once you get the hang of the organization, it is easy to undestand the structure of the site. There are easy-to-find links for all necessary and common needs, and overall the structure of the site was well done.
</p>


<h3>
4: Site Graphics/ Other Media
</h3>
<p>
the site graphics, while unique, stylish, and exciting, also add to the cluttered feel of the site. The pictures can feel a bit random and add to the confusion.
</p>


<h3>
5: Time to load
</h3>
<p>
The site loaded quickly.
</p>


<h3>
6: Text and Color
</h3>
<p>
The text is clear, well organized with headings, and easy to read. It is also a font that adds to the bulletin board style. 
</p>


<h3>
7: Site Navigation
</h3>
<p>
As I mentioned before, the site navigation can be tricky at first. There is a navigation tool, but the way that things are made to look like they were "posted" on the site makes information uneven, appearing in e=unexpected areas and intermingled with less useful information and graphics.
</p>


<h3>
8: Color Scheme
</h3>
<p>
The color scheme is white, and it is followed well throughout the site. The white scheme is another thing that I would change, as it makes the website feel less professional. The links and graphics make the site feel like a news board, why now allow for a cork-textured background? Any earthy-colored background would work well as well.
</p>


<h3>
9: Responsive Design
</h3>
<p>
The website does have a responsive design.
</p>


<h3>
10: Uniqueness of Site
</h3>
<p>
Overall, the website is a unique experience. Despite the confusion, it was well done and fun to navigate. The website is inviting, and makes me feel a certain kinship with the franchise, as if it were a small locally-owned store from my hometown.
