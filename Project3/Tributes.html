<h2>Testimonials of Backyard Birds</h2>

<h3>"The colors are so brilliantly captured"</h3><img class="right" src= "images/Tributes/robinSm.jpg" alt="Robin">
<p>My name is Dave Jorgensen. I live in northern Utah and I enjoy bird watching. Every year I look forward to finding a nature calendar to put in my office. Because I work in the city, I enjoy being reminded about the beauty of the state of Utah. I was excited to find the calendar offered by Bart Jones. I recognize some of the bird varieties from my own back yard, but I was amazed to see the wide variety of birds he has captured with his camera in his Eureka neighborhood. The colors of the birds are so brilliantly captured that they look very real.

<h3>"Bart Jones has inspired me" </h3>
<p><img class="right" src= "images/Tributes/BaldEagleSm.jpg" alt="Bald Eagle">Wow!!! Who would have thought all these birds live in Utah. I was attracted to the Birds of Utah calendar because of the great horned owl on the cover. I especially like finding and  watching raptors such as: hawks, bald and golden eagles, vultures and owls. It is very rare  to have some of these big raptors show up in your own yard. Bart Jones has inspired me to  get out my 35mm camera and try to see what birds I can attract to my own backyard. I can't  wait to see what he comes up with for next year's calendar.
